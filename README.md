# Building Pocket-Sized Terminal UIs with Rust 🦀👨‍🍳

> Ratatui is a Rust library for building fast and modern terminal UIs, now capable to run even on your toaster!
>
> In this talk, Orhun Parmaksiz (open source developer and maintainer of Ratatui) will take us on a whirlwind tour of what Ratatui is capable of, from system tools and games to musical instruments. After that, we will jump into a hands-on workshop where we will build a TUI application from scratch and use Ratatui's newly added no_std support to run it on a tiny display that fits in your pocket! (ESP32 T-Display)
>
> We will also host a fun mini-competition where the top 3 workshop projects, as voted by participants, will get to keep the device.
>
> Join us for a session packed with awesome terminal UIs and hands-on hacking with embedded Rust!
